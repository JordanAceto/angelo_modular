FETs that might work for the sub-oscillator:
    bf245a
    2n5485
    2n5457
    pn4391?

    try to buy a few SMD FETs with similar characteristics and try them out


sub-oscillator general:
    make sure the saw from the CEM3340 VCO works! must be +/-5v falling saw


5-pulser:
    double check the CV scaling to make sure it feels good


VCO carrier board Octave switch:
    try it out to make sure it works ok


VCF carrier board:
    try it out to make sure it works


VCA:
    double check everything


MS20 VCF:
    double check everything
