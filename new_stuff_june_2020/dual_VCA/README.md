# SSM2164 based dual VCA PCB

# Warning, this project is a work in progress!!! The schematic and pcb are unverified. When boards have been ordered, built, and tested I'll remove this warning.

## Features:
- Two independent linear VCAs
- Manual offset controls
- Attenuated CV inputs
- Unity gain at +5 volts CV
- AC/DC coupling selected by solder jumper
- Designed to either use board mounted pots and jacks which affix directly to a panel, or mount to a bracket and wire by hand
