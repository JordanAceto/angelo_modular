# This is currently just a dumping ground for schematics and pcb layouts as I spruce up an old modular project. 

## The synth is a custom 5u format modular with space for 12 modules. It generally follows the electronotes standards of +/-5 volt waveforms, 100k input impedance, and 1k output impedance. It was originally all built on perf-board. I am now remaking most of the modules with manufactured pcbs, and generally sprucing things up. I also hope to improve the documentation.

## this repo is a work in progress and a snapshot in time.

### When finished, each module subdirectory should have:
- complete and correct kicad docs for the schematic and pcb
- zipped gerbers
- an interactive BOM
- a user manual, or at least a quick readme with calibration instructions
- a pdf copy of the schematic
- power supply current requirements noted somewhere
